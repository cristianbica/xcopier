# Xcopier

Xcopier is a tool to copy data from one database to another. It is designed to be used in a development environment to copy data from a production database to a local database (e.g. to test a data migration or data fix) allowing you to overide and/or anonymize the data.

:warning: :warning: :warning:

This is a "sharp knife" tool. It can be used to copy data from one database to another. Make sure you properly set the source and destination connections to avoid data loss or corruption.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add xcopier --group=development
```

## Usage

Create a file (e.g. `app/libs/company_copier.rb`) and define a class that includes `Xcopier::DSL`.

You could also use the generator provided by this gem:

```bash
bundle exec rails genereate xcopier:copier company
```

```ruby
class CompanyCopier
  include Xcopier::DSL

  # you can use here a symbol to reference a connection defined in database.yml
  #  or a hash with connection details
  #  or a string with a connection url
  source :production
  destination :development

  argument :company_ids, :integer, list: true

  copy :companies, scope: -> { Company.where(id: arguments[:company_ids]) }
  copy :users, scope: -> { User.where(company_id: arguments[:company_ids]) }, chunk_size: 100
end
```

Then run the copier:

```bash
bundle exec xcopier company --company-ids 1,2
```

The above will load your app, instantiate the `CompanyCopier` class and run the `copy` method for the `companies` and `users` tables.

You could also do this from a Rails console:

```ruby
CompanyCopier.new(company_ids: [1, 2]).run
# or give the argument as a string and it will be parsed
CompanyCopier.new(company_ids: "1,2").run
```

### Arguments

The DSL includes an `argument` directive. It's purpose is to provide copier arguments to be used in queries to copy data. It supports typecasting for the following types: string, integer, time, date, boolean. You can also specify if the argument is a list by setting the `list` option to `true`.

Example:

```ruby
argument :str, :string
argument :str_list, :string, list: true
argument :int, :integer
argument :int_list, :integer, list: true
argument :time, :time # it will parse the time using Time.parse
argument :date, :date # it will parse the date using Date.parse
argument :bool, :boolean # it will recognize as truthy the values: "1", "yes", "true", true

copier.new(str: "string", str_list: "string1,string2", int: "1", int_list: "1,2", time: "2020-01-01 12:00", date: "2020-01-01
", bool: "true")

copier.arguments[:str] # => "string"
copier.arguments[:str_list] # => ["string1", "string2"]
copier.arguments[:int] # => 1
copier.arguments[:int_list] # => [1, 2]
copier.arguments[:time] # => Time.parse("2020-01-01 12:00")
copier.arguments[:date] # => Date.parse("2020-01-01")
copier.arguments[:bool] # => true
```

Example:

```ruby

copy :companies, anonymize: true

copy :users,
     model: User, # this is not actually needed, it will be inferred from the name
     scope: -> { User.all }, # this is also not needed as .all on the model is the default
     chunk_size: 500, # this is the default value
     overrides: {
       email: ->(email) { email.gsub(/@/, "+#{SecureRandom.hex(4)}@") },
       password: "password",
       last_login_at: -> (last_login_at, attributes) { attributes[:created_at] + 1.minute }
     },
     anonymize: %w(first_name last_name street_address)
```

### Copy Operations

The `copy` directive is to instruct the copier what to copy. It accepts the following options:
- `name`
   - a name for the copy operation (usually the table name)
   - will be used to determine the model if not given
- `model`
  - the model to use for the copy operation
  - if not given it will be inferred from the `name`
- `scope`
  - a lambda that returns the records to be copied
  - if not given it will copy all records using the `model.all`
- `chunk_size`
  - the number of records to copy at once
  - default value is `500`
- `overrides`
  - rules to transform the data before writing
  - it is a hash where the key is the column name and the replacement is the value
  - the value can be a lambda that returns the new value
  - the lambda can receive no arguments or a single argument with the original value or two arguments with the original value and a hash of the record
- `anonymize`
  - where to try to anonymize the data
  - can be `true` to anonymize all columns or a list of columns to anonymize
  - more on the anonymization in the next section
  - anonymization is not done for columns that have an override
  - anonymization is done in the [`Xcopier::Anonymizer`](https://github.com/cristianbica/xcopier/blob/master/lib/xcopier/anonymizer.rb) class, is based on the column name and uses the [faker](https://rubygems.org/gems/faker) gem
  - :warning: anonymization is not guaranteed to be secure and has currently a limited implementation
  - feel free to adjust it in your app (`Xcopier::Anonymizer::RULES` is a mutable hash where the key is a regex to match the column and the value is a lambda that returns the anonymized value) or contribute to this gem


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
